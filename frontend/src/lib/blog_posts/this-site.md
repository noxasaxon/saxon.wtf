## Notes

### Key Technologies
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev)
    - Much, much less verbose than React.
    - No virtualDOM, everything is precompiled to vanillaJS
- [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev)
    - The official Svelte toolkit, similar to React's NextJS
    - File-based routing, prerendered static pages, server-side rendering
- [mdsvex](https://mdsvex.pngwn.io)
    - Transforms Markdown files into svelte components, and you can run svelte code inside the .md file
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
